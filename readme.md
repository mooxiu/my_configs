# My configuration

My config contains some config files and flows I'd like to follow when I have to set a new computer. 
Currently my main working PCs are Macs, so this repository is largely Mac based.

## Before all

- (Mac) Installation of homebrew
- Configuration for zsh + OhMyZsh following: https://gist.github.com/n1snt/454b879b8f0b7995740ae04c5fb5b7df
- fastfetch (neofetch is not maintained anymore)

## Terminal

- I have been using iTerm2 for a long time, but now I switch to Alacritty.
    - configurations under `terminal`
- Powerlevel10k terminal theme: https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k

## Vim

I'm a heavy vim user, or should I say I am a heavy vim key binding user. I don't really use vim as an IDE, so just some lightweight configurations.

- Neovim: https://github.com/neovim/neovim
- Vim editor, I just follow https://vim-bootstrap.com/ which can help to generate a .vimrc to use

## Git

I use some shortcut for git, but I don't want to make it super difficult to remember especially we still need to use git on some machines we don't have control. 

- see: gitconfig.md
